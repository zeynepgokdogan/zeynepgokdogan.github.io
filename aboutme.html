    <h1>Zeynep</h1>
    <p>In 2019, I graduated from Gaziantep Anatolian High School. 
        I completed one year of English preparatory education at the upper intermediate level.
        I am a 3rd-year student at Ankara Yildirim Beyazit University Computer Engineering Department.
        In previous years, I developed mobile games with C++ using the Qt game engine.
        We are developing mobile application projects using Flutter with my teammates. 
        I also have knowledge about Python, C, C++, Dart, and Java languages.</p>
