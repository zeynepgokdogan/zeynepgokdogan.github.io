          <h2>Oatmeal Diet Cookies</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>Ingredients:</strong>
            1 cup oatmeal 1 banana 1 egg white Half tea glass walnut Half tea
            glass raisins 4 dates 1 dried fig 1 teaspoon baking powder
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Instructions:</strong>
            After whisking the egg white a little and making it thicken, we put
            1 medium-sized banana into it and crush it. Then we add oats and
            other ingredients. I did not write the amount of walnuts or anything
            else, it is completely up to you, I used very little. When all the
            ingredients are mixed and reach the consistency that we can shape
            without sticking to our hands, we put it on greaseproof paper and
            bake it in a preheated 180 degree oven. If the mixture sticks to our
            hands, you can add a little more oats, bon appetit.

          <h2>Zucchini Sandal with Cheese</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>Ingredients:</strong>
            4 medium-sized courgettes 2 eggs 200 gr white cheese Parsley Black
            pepper, chilli flakes
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Instructions:</strong>
            Scrape the outside of 4 courgettes, divide them into 2 lengthwise
            and boil them in water with the addition of salt. While boiling, we
            should be careful that they do not fall apart. After cooling down a
            little bit, remove the seeds in the centre of the zucchini with a
            spoon and put them in a strainer and wait for the water to drain
            well. Mash the cheese in a bowl, add 2 eggs, chopped parsley, black
            pepper and chilli flakes and mix them with a fork. Fill into the
            courgettes. Place in the grill function of the oven at 220 degrees
            until the top turns golden brown. It can be served hot or cold.
            Enjoy your meal.
